                    <p>The massive reduction in bee colonies today has become an issue on the agenda all over the world.
                        According to US
                        National Agricultural Statistics, the number of hives in the country has been reduced by 60%
                        between 1947 and 2008,
                        from 6 million to 2.4 million. Among the reasons for the decline are climate change and its
                        adverse effects,
                        tick-borne illnesses that are common among bees, an increase in the population of bee-eating
                        birds,
                        and pesticides used in horticulture.

                        Has the trend in bee colony reduction been felt in Armenia as well? What difficulties have

                        chosen due to the fact that apricots and a number of
                        other crops bloom early; therefore, beekeeping
                        season starts and ends early here.</p>

                        We conducted the survey among 20 beekeepers in settlements in the
                        Ararat region. The settlements were selected using QGIS, a geographic i
                        nformation system application, which randomly selected 20 out of 95 settlements.
                        Individual beekeepers in the chosen settlements participated in the survey.
                        As a principle, those who were first to respond were selected.
                        <br><br>
                        Most beekeepers are elderly, and beekeeping is typically work that is passed
                        down in the family. Half of the 20 beekeepers surveyed have been
                        engaged in this work for over 20 years.
                        <br><br>
                        Among the randomly selected respondents were one woman beekeeper and one
                        national minority representative from the Assyrian community.

                        According to the survey data, there has been a general declining trend in the number of bee
                        colonies since 2017.

                        As of April 1, 2021, the decline has been sharp. Of the 20 surveyed beekeepers,
                        15 believe that the number of bee colonies has decreased over the last 5 years.
                        <br><br>
                        Many of the beekeepers reported that there have also been losses among beekeepers they know in
                        other regions.

                        Data provided by the Ararat regional administration corroborates the decline in bee colonies.
                        The year 2018 stands out in particular, as 1,200 more registered bee colonies were lost as
                        compared to the year before. The declining trend was also found in later
                        years but was not as sharp. If we look at the data per region, more than 2,200

                        bee colonies were lost in Ararat city, where beekeeping is most active and flourishing. In the
                        area around Masis,
                        around 150 hives were lost, whereas in the region around Artashat the number of bee colonies
                        increased by around 300.

                    <p>Causes for the decline<br><br>
                        Many beekeepers don’t know the reasons for the massive decline in their bees.
                        The following image is derived from the survey results where many
                        share their speculations.
                        <br><br>
                        Most of the beekeepers believe that the main reason for the
                        loss of bee colonies is disease and the use of fertilizers that are not bee-friendly.
                        There is also distrust around bee medications.

                        of Environment Erik Grigoryan in the 4th National Climate Change Report.
                        Climate change encompasses all fluctuations in the climate that last longer than specific
                        weather events and relates to only those fluctuations that remain for a long period, usually
                        decades or more.
                        That change is anthropogenic global warming, which scientists say began in the 1800s.
                        According to the National Union of Beekeepers, honey production in the country declined 10-fo
                        ld due to unfavorable climatic conditions. Bees work at a slower pace when temperatures increase
                        above 30C.
                        <br>
                        Bees work most diligently at 18-25C.

                        Climate change not only reduces bee efficiency but also time asymmetry. When spring comes early,
                        that is when temperatures are above normal,
                        the flowering process for trees and agricultural crops begins early. Bees that have just woken
                        up from winter are not ready to collect nectar at that time.

                        Bee-eating birds (Meropidae) are regular unwanted guests of beekeepers that approach
                        hives in cloudy weather, especially before or after it rains.
                        Nine out of the 20 beekeepers surveyed believe that the number of bee attacks
                        by bee-eating birds has increased over the last 5 years and that,
                        in general, the population of
                        that bird species has increased. Seven of the beekeepers disagree,
                        while 4 have not noticed any variations in trends.</p>

                    <p>In fighting against bee-eaters, beekeepers resort to various tricks,
                        the most common of which is to drive them out with sound.
                        One method of using sound against feathered predators is to hit metal objects together to scare
                        them.
                        Another is to use so-called “baby” or New Year’s Eve fireworks, sometimes with the use of a
                        sling to fire them into the air.
                        Some beekeepers report firing into the air with gunpowder. Others choose to shoot at the birds.
                        It should be noted that the green species of bee-eating birds are registered in the Republic of
                        Armenia’s
                        Red Book (Decision N71 of the RA Government as of January 29, 2010), with a status of highly
                        endangered.
                        They are widely killed by beekeepers, since they look similar to the golden bee-eaters.

                    <p>Queen bee<br><br>
                        The three types of bees in the colony are the worker bees, drones (male),
                        and queen bee, which is the largest (up to 25 mm long).
                        The latter is only responsible for reproducing the next generation by laying eggs.
                        Under favorable conditions, the number of spawns per day can reach 2,000 or more.
                        The queen bee can live for 5 years, but after 2 years her spawning efficiency decreases.
                        Therefore, it is necessary to replace the old queen bee with a young one every 2 years</p>

                        Eight did not agree nor disagree with the statement. Only 2 reported having problems, pointing
                        out
                        that queen bees left and didn’t return, which of course irreversibly impacts bee colonies and

                        The active beekeeping season, the time when bee nectar is collected, is over when the flowers on
                        trees fall
                        and the other grasses and vegetation are not enough for bees to make honey.
                        That is why nearly all beekeepers in regions with climatic conditions similar to Ararat move
                        their hives to other areas full of flowering trees and vegetation.
                        Mountainous regions are considered to be the best honey-producing areas,
                        where abundant honey is obtained in hot and humid years.

                    <p> A microbiome is the collective genome of microbes, consisting of bacteria, bacteriophages,
                        fungi, protozoa, and viruses, that live inside the body of a living organism–in this case, in the intestines of bees.
                        <br><br>
                       "Studies have shown that bees die when there are changes to their gut microbiomes. The most interesting thing we
                       discovered during the experiments is the presence of the Bartonella bacteria in bee intestines,
                       which is dangerous and pathogenic to humans.
                       We have not yet identified the species to be able to clearly say that it is the one
                       dangerous to humans, but we think that the lactic acid bacteria in bee intestines keep the pathogens suppressed.
                       That is why the bee does not die or is not considered the causative agent of those diseases,” explains Inga Bazukyan.
                       <br><br>
                       Originally, the research team’s thinking was that the bacteria in bee intestines could regulate insect health and
                        immunity and could become more resistant to fertilizers and various diseases,
                       which may help to solve the problem of the massive decline in bees.

                    <br><br>
                    Different species of bees live in the territory of Armenia, of which the
                    Armenian yellow is an endangered species. During the Soviet years, people brought different bees
                    from different countries,
                    which had racial similarities with the Armenian species and mixed. Genetically impure subspecies emerged from
                     mixing at the subspecies level, meaning that no new species is born. This phenomenon is called metisation.
                     <br><br>
                    "We do not have a pure species today, as we lost the aborigines,” says Martin Rukhkyan, a senior researcher
                     at the General Helminthology and Parasitology Laboratory and PhD Candidate in Parasitology

                <p>Everything in nature works on the principle of "mutual agreement". Each area has bees whose trunk length allows for
                    collecting nectar from flowers in the area. Different bee species have different trunk lengths. According to physical
                    data, bees that are not native may go hungry from not being able to receive or only partially receive food from flowers,
                    which suggests that subspecies resulting from a mix of local and imported breeds are also at risk.
                    <br><br>
                    Tick specialist Rukhkyan thinks that the mixing of bees may be the reason for the decline of bees in Armenia, thus the
                    need to work on purifying bee genetics using molecular genetics.

                <p>According to a beekeeper with decades of experience, medicines should be tried on one bee colony first, then given to others by
                    reading the instructions on the prescription, such as spreading greasy paper under the frames in the hive, tracing the signs, and so on.

                    "It is necessary to renew the bee population every five years to avoid perversion. "Generations of 'sister-brother' bees of the same

                <p> Even in studying only the experience of beekeepers in the Ararat region, a number of factors and problems
                    emerged that could be the cause for the decline in the number of bee colonies.
                    A final conclusion may only be reached after studying all regions of Armenia. Over the summer,
                     we will be conducting surveys with 100 beekeepers from all regions of Armenia.
